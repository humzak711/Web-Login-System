# FlaskWebServer-basic
basic web server written in python using the flask framework

to install flask, run pip3 install flask on your terminal
I recommend running this code using a python3.11 environment

IMPORTANT
- change all url's for url redirects on the html templates to your own localhost,
  e.g. if your localhost runs on port 8080, change '<!-- your localhost --> to 127.0.0.1:8080
  in all occurences of your '<!-- localhost -->

- This code assumes you are using a MySQL database, if you are not then make changes
  to the code accordingly

- This code works best in a python 3.11 environment
